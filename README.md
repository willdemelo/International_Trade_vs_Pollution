# International Trade vs Pollution
Using the University of Gothenberg's Quality of Government (QoG) Dataset, I wanted to draw some comparisons between the data available for metrics of international trade and pollution, and compare my findings to what is suggested by current research on the subject.

## Project Overview
In the articles I had read on the matter, international trade and pollution should be positively correlated. In other words, the more a country conducts trade with other countries, the more polluted it should be. However, the varied metrics I used to operationally define pollution and international trade showed that the variables tended to be negatively correlated, or have weak/non-existent correlations. I concluded that further research into more specific areas of pollution was necessary to explain my findings fully.

The visualizations I created for this project are available to view in .html format. As some of the graphs I made are interactable, GitHub cannot properly display them, nor can one use them. To view the vizualizations, please download the .html file and view it in your browser. The jupyter notebook I have for this repository can be used to reproduce my code.
