Using the University of Gothenberg's Quality of Government (QoG) Dataset, I wanted to draw some comparisons between the data available for metrics of international trade and pollution, and compare my findings to what is suggested by current research on the subject.

Overall, my findings were unexpected in that I had thought pollution and international trade would be positively correlated among countries. However, what I found was that the variables tended to be negatively correlated, or not correlated at all, contrary to what I had read in my research on the matter.

My findings, including all of the visualizations I created, are available to view in .html format. To view the vizualizations, please download the .html file and view it in your browser. Additionally, one can reproduce my code using the jupyter notebook I have.
